<h1>Sloths</h1>
<p>About Sloths: Sloths are mammals and quite common in Central and South America. Sloths are tree dwellers, sluggish and live in tropical rainforests. Sloths have a low metabolic rate and their diet is mostly leaves, they are fugal eaters and mostly herbivorous. They move slowly to expend less energy and don't travel very far in one day.</p>

        


<h2>Types of Sloths </h2>

<p> There are two different types of sloths, two-toed and three-toed, and six species: Pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus),
Maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), Pale-throated sloth (Bradypus tridactylus), Brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus), Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus), Hoffman's two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni)
</p>

<p class= "fancy"> 
Sloths of the two-toed variety are omnivores. They eat plants, small lizards and insects. Sloths of the three-toed eat most plants. This makes them consideried herbivores.
</p>

<p> Sloths thrive in South America and Central America. 70 percent of tree-dwelling mammals live on Panama's Barro Colorado Island. Of the six spiecies of sloths two are considered endangered. Panama's pygmy sloth that lives on that country's islands is critically endangered.
